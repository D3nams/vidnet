# Requirements Document

## Introduction

VidNet is a next-generation HD video downloader designed for speed, simplicity, and scalability. The MVP focuses on delivering core value through reliable high-definition downloads from popular platforms (YouTube, TikTok, Instagram, Facebook) via a fast, clean, ad-free interface. The system prioritizes instant processing, metadata preview, and scalable infrastructure without unnecessary complexity like user authentication or subscriptions.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

3. WHEN a user selects a video quality THEN the system SHALL initiate download preparation within 3 seconds
4. IF the platform is supported (YouTube, TikTok, Instagram, Facebook) THEN the system SHALL process the download request
5. WHEN download is complete THEN the system SHALL provide a direct download link with auto-cleanup after 30 minutes

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to extract audio from videos as MP3 files, so that I can save just the audio content when I don't need the video.

#### Acceptance Criteria

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to preview video metadata before downloading, so that I can confirm I'm downloading the correct content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a valid URL is submitted THEN the system SHALL display video thumbnail, title, and duration

3. WHEN system resources are under load THEN the system SHALL maintain response times under 3 seconds for download preparation
4. WHEN temporary files are created THEN the system SHALL automatically clean them up after 30 minutes
5. IF system reaches capacity limits THEN the system SHALL queue requests gracefully with user notification

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to work reliably across different platforms, so that I can download content from my preferred social media sites.

3. WHEN displaying the interface THEN the system SHALL include strategically placed, non-intrusive ad slots (header banner, sidebar)
4. WHEN users wait for download preparation THEN the system SHALL optionally display rewarded video ads with skip option
5. WHEN users interact with ads THEN the system SHALL track click-through rates and revenue per user
6. WHEN collecting user data THEN the system SHALL implement GDPR/CCPA compliant consent management
7. IF ad revenue is insufficient THEN the system SHALL prepare A/B tests for premium feature upsells
